Good:
Comments that divided functions by purpose were helpful
Code was fairly easy to understand
HTML was well organized
Cool that you have a cancel button (Y)
Minimalist design is easy on the eyes

Bad:
Useless files and functions in code, confusing
Mixed SQL in app.py even though most of the functionality came from data_david.py
Test cases that weren't too organized, some don't match function parameters
A lot of commented code...
Some variable names were unclear (aname?)
When you write a post, you need to have text in order to cancel
Cancel registration doesn't work, nor does cancel 
Log-in to write a comment page doesn't look nice :'(
